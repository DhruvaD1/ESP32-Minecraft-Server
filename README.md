Trying to use claude to see how well it works at embedded programming. Got the server running, 5 player multiplayer works, random world generation, 1.21.4 support, and creative mode working.

Work still to be done: Better Water Biome Generation, Support for survival and hardcore modes, larger render distance without sacrificing performance, and want to add support for 10 people at a time on the server.
